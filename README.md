### Instructions:
Use the 100 line version if you want to run this on the Raspberry pi. The higher memory and processing requirements of the other version makes it better suited for something with more computational power. Alternatively you could use something like a Coral TPU or a web-server to handle some of that processing and use the Raspberry-Pi for control
